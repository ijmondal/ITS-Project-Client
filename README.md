# ITS-Project-Client
Client Side

This is the Django project corresponding to the client side of the website called "AgroFarms" which uses APIs provided by another project to access the required database. Any change made in the database on the server side will almost immediately be reflected in the client side.

For running the client side:

In root directory:
python manage.py runserver 0:<any port number except 8025>
